1kShmup
=======

1kShmup was my go at the [js1k](http://js1k.com) contest. Turns out JavaScript compression is rather difficult, 
I wasn't able to get the game below 1.7k, and that was using the png-compression trick ;)<br/>
But in case anybody ever comes up with a 1.7k JavaScript contest I'm all go...

The game was coded in half an afternoon and is thus rather lame - just try to survive and kill as many enemies as possible.
Use [WSAD] to move and point the mouse to aim, ever so often your weapon will get a power-up, enabling you to kill 
enemies faster.<br/>
The game clearly is inspired by [Geometry Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars), try it!

Also: Please don't look an the source - it's horrible.
