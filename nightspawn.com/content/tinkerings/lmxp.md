LMXP is an XML-Parser completely written in Java. 
I won't tell you what the acronym stands for - go figure. I wrote this because all the 
other free XML parsers I found out there were huge and therefore damn slow. 
In it's days LMXP was quite a bit faster than for example apache.org's Xerces2-J.

Nowadays there are a lot of excellent, fast and free XML parsers out there so I don't 
recommend using LMXP at all, as it iscurrently rather incomplete (though it tends to do 
what I wrote it for). As a first "real" software project it was a really good experience, 
and you can still download it for historical purposes:
