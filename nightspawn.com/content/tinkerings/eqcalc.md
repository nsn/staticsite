EQCalc is an online poker hand equity calculator<br/>
It allows you to pit up to 10 hands against each other. It is kind of limited as unfortunately google is kind of a 
pussy when it comes to excessive CPU-heavy calculations on their app-engine cloud computing plattform ;)

try it online at [eqcalc.appspot.com](http://eqcalc.appspot.com)
