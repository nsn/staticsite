PongOut is a game we made during the first official [GameForge](http://gameforge.com) GameJam.

Considering we only had 48 hours it's an ok game, even though it still contains colourful assortment of bugs. You can 
[play PongOut online](http://pong-out.appspot.com) (you'll probably need a modern browser capable of creating a GL context) 
or you can [download the binaries](http://satansoft.de/pongout/pongout.zip) 
([Java7 JRE required](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)).
The [source](https://github.com/nsn/pongout) is available on GitHub, please don't ever look at it, it's hideous :)
