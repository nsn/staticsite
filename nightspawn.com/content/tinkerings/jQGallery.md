title: jQGallery
---

Somehow I decided I needed to up my Javascript- and JQuery-fu so I wrote jQGallery, a jQuery-plugin that 
renders [picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) and [twitpic](http://twitpic.com) photos and galleries.

jQGallery is used to render most of the galleries on this site, as well as some other sites I run.

Go clone the [github repository](https://github.com/nsn/jQgallery), use it for free and change stuff.
Also if you need a feature just [drop me a line](mailto:nsn@nightspawn.com) or better yet, implement it
yourself and send me a pull request ;)

For help on how to use it see the [examples page](http://satansoft.de/jQGallery/example.html)
