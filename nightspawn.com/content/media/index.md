Media
=====

This is a quite useless listing of all the noise I subject my brain to on a regular basis.
I will expand this listing whenever I feel like something needs adding, and as a result of that
it will never be complete or even significant in any way, shape or form.


Music
-----

I do enjoy a wide range of music, but generally it's more alternative than mainstream, more metal than electro.

### Oomph! ###
Once my favorite band, but their post 2000 stuff has gotten more and more mainstream

### Ramms+ein ###
Huge fan pretty much from their first demo tape on out

### Haggard ###
Their album "Eppur si muove" singlehandedly takes the title of "best melodic metal" album of all time. 
Seriously - go check it out if you haven't done so yet

### Fear Factory ###
Demanufacture is huge, as is their newest creation Mechanize

Games
-----

I do like a lot of games, and I used to put in quite a lot of hours playing them, but right now between working 
in the games industry, my other hobbies and maintaining at least some resemblence of a social life I just don't 
find a lot of time to dedicate to gaming.

Also - considering the last games I truly played being Picross, Picross3D and Plants vs. Zombies I probably have 
to face the fact that I might have become a casual gamer...

### Chrono Series ###
Chrono Trigger is probably the best JRPG ever, and Chrono Cross might be the single game I have to fondest memories of 


Books
-----

I read quite a lot, even if my hunger for books seems to come in waves.

### Neil Stephenson ###
Probably anything he wrote, but I enjoyed "The Big U" and "Diamond Age" the most.

### Jim Butcher/The Dresden case files ###
I heard [Day9](http://day9tv.blip.tv) talking about the series, and actually bought the first book while on vacation
in Dubai.

Movies
------

Just a list of movies I actually re-watched several times:

-  Fight Club
-  Koyaanisqatsi
