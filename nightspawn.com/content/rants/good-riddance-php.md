  abstract: "I just got rid of the last bit of PHP source code in my life and I swore to myself: I will never touch that shit-pile of a language ever again."

For 8 years I was a PHP developer. I contributed to the [XP-Framework](http://www.xp-framework.info/) and in my thesis I even 
[integrated the Zend-Engine into the Java-VM](/tinkerings/turpitude/). I know what I am talking about - and I say: don't use PHP!. Ever.
Technologically PHP is at least 10 years behind the rest of the "web"-languages. The underlying Zend-Engine contains some of the worst C-code I've ever seen.
There are [countless](http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp) [sites](http://phpsadness.com/) explaining in great detail why and where the language is broken. 

And I simply can not think of a single reason to chose PHP over any other language for "web programming": Java, Ruby, Python - even Perl are more stable,
have better performance, better libraries and better communities to learn from.

so: **Good riddance PHP - and fuck you!**
