Every keyboard sucks (and blows)
================================

Why is it so damn hard to buy a decent keyboard? 

For the longest time now I typed on an excellent Enermax Aurora, so when I now needed a new keyboard 
I naturally wanted to buy the successor: <a href="http://enermax.com/home.php?fn=eng/product_a1_1_1&lv0=3&lv1=12&no=65">the enermax Acrylux</a>. 
Unfortunately it is *absolutely* impossible to buy an Acrylux with en_US layout - damn! 

So I lamented for a while and then ordered the <a href="http://www.cherry.de/cid/corded_keyboards_EASYHUB_Corded_MultiMedia_Keyboard.htm?">cherry easyhub</a>.
It arrived, but I didn't quite like the fact that the keys are very close together, also the dash-key was physically broken.

So now I'm typing on a <a href="http://www.cherry.de/cid/corded_keyboards_STRAIT_BLACK_Corded_Keyboard.htm?">cherry STRAIT</a>, but it feels very, very flimsy,
and the insert/delete/home/end/... block is rotated 90 degrees - meh.

Anyways: does anybody know a flat keyboard with a decent feel to the keys that I can actually buy an american layout version of in germany? I'd rather have a 
corded version, and a built-in USB-hub is a bonus. Any pointers?
