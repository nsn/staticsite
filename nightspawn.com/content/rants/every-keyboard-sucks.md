  title: "every keyboard sucks"
  author_name: nsn
  abstract: "My keyboard is the most important tool I work with. It is only sensible that I choose a keyboard that suits my needs perfectly, and I am willing to spend
             a considerable amount of money on a decent one - for health reasons alone if not for comfort. So why is it so damn difficult to buy one?"

For the longest time now I typed on an excellent Enermax Aurora - it is very well made, flat (which is good for my wrists) and yet has good key resistence and feedback.
But one thing always bothered me: it doesn't have a US key layout but rather some strange mix of US and UK - most notably it has a "large" return key, which displaces the
backspace and backslash/pipe keys. I've also grown to love the built-in USB hub.

So when I now needed a new keyboard to replace the old, crappy and filthy standard cherry piece of crap at home 
I naturally wanted to buy the successor: <a href="http://enermax.com/home.php?fn=eng/product_a1_1_1&lv0=3&lv1=12&no=65">the enermax Acrylux</a>. 
Unfortunately it is *absolutely* impossible to buy an Acrylux with en_US layout here in germany - damn! 

So I lamented for a while and then ordered the <a href="http://www.cherry.de/cid/corded_keyboards_EASYHUB_Corded_MultiMedia_Keyboard.htm?">cherry easyhub</a>.
It arrived, but the fact that the keys are huge, very close together and worst of all: aren't beveled make it very difficult to type on, and my rate of error
skyrocketed. Also the keys have nothing on the Aurora's and feel rather flimsy in comparison.

I then ordered a <a href="http://www.cherry.de/cid/corded_keyboards_STRAIT_BLACK_Corded_Keyboard.htm?">cherry STRAIT</a>... *what a piece of crap*!
It is built to look like the stylish apple keyboards (which I know almost nothing about), but falls short in all other areas:
it feels flimsy as hell and lacks feedback on whether you actually pressed a key or not - horrible! Also the insert/delete/home/end/... block is rotated 90 degrees - 
catastrophic for a vim-lover-yet-insert-lamer like me.

So: does anybody know a flat keyboard with a decent feel to the keys that I can actually buy an american layout version of here in germany? I'd rather have a 
corded version, and a built-in USB-hub is a bonus. Any pointers?
