I needed to get rid of the last piece of PHP software in my life: 
the disaster-pile that was the last version of my personal website. So while looking at different static website generators
I came across [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ "nanoc homepage"). 

So far the experience has been great, nanoc allows authoring of content in a plethora of formats, including HTML, Ruby and 
most notably [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "markdown"). Nanoc outputs plain HTML files which can be hosted
almost anywhere, absolutely no server side code needed - no more having to constantly proof against spammers and hackers and best of all: 
no more PHP!

The only downside so far has been the fact that I had to learn some basic ruby in oder to be able to add custom functionality - oh well...
