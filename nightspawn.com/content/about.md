My name is Michael Bayer, I live in Karlsruhe, Germany and I am pretty old for my age.

I currently work as a software engineer at [Gameforge AG](http://corporate.gameforge.com/en/), mainly developing 
JEE applications for large MMORPGs. Former employers include [1&1](httt://einsundeins.com) and Schlund+Partner (RIP).
I have a degree in Computer Sciences from the [university of applied science, Karlsruhe](http://hs-karlsruhe.de/).

I like wasting my time with

-   coding - as of late I developed an unhealthy fascination with JEE
-   snowboarding (unfortunately not as much as a want to anymore)
-   traveling <a href="/travels/">(envy my pictures!)</a>
-   retro gaming (I consider myself to be the best puzzle bobble player in the world)
-   foosball (table soccer - whatever)

You can reach me via email at [nsn@nightspawn.com](mailto:nsn@nightspawn.com), check out my twitter account
