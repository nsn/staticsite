<img src="/images/about/me.png"/>
My name is Michael Bayer, I live in Karlsruhe, Germany and I am pretty old for my age.

I currently work as a software engineer at [Gameforge AG](http://corporate.gameforge.com/en/), mainly developing 
JEE applications for large MMORPGs. Former employers include [1&1](httt://einsundeins.com) and Schlund+Partner (RIP).
I have a degree in Computer Sciences from the [university of applied science, Karlsruhe](http://hs-karlsruhe.de/).

My hobbies include:

-   coding - lately developing JEE applications (not for large MMORPGs though)
-   snowboarding (unfortunately not as much as a want to anymore)
-   traveling (envy my pictures!)
-   retro gaming (I consider myself to be the best puzzle bobble player in the world)
-   foosball (table soccer - whatever)

You can reach me via email at [nsn@nightspawn.com](mailto:nsn@nightspawn.com), check out my twitter account
[@pneis](http://twitter.com/pneis), or just find me on [facebook](http://facebook.com) or [xing](http://xing.com).

this site
---------

I thought it was about time to update my personal web page, so here it is: the all-new, all-static version 4.0!
After several tries using various website generators (even writing my own) and the PHP desaster that was the last version
this time I decided to use [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ "nanoc homepage") - a static website generator.

So far the experience has been great, nanoc allows authoring of content in a plethora of formats, including HTML, Ruby, erb and 
most notably [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "markdown"). Nanoc outputs plain HTML files which can be hosted
almost anywhere, absolutely no server side code needed - no more having to constantly proof against spammers and hackers and best of all: 
no more PHP!

The only downside so far has been the fact that I had to learn some basic ruby in oder to be able to add custom functionality - oh well...
